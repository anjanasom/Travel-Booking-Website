# Travel-Booking-Website
 
This is a basic mock travel booking website created as a college project. The objective of this website is to allow users to find trains, flights, and hotels to their desired location. While it does not allow actual payment and therefore ticket/ room booking, it does enable real-time search.

This website makes use of third-party APIs for searching trains, flights, and hotels based on required criterias.
